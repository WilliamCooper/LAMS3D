\section*{Overview}

The procedure used to measure wind via the radome uses ``sensitivity
coefficients'' that relate the pressure differences between vertically
separated ports on the radome to angle of attack. These coefficients
are usually determined using speed runs, where the angle of attack
gradually changes as the speed increases and decreases in level flight.
If it is assumed that the vertical wind is zero during the maneuver,
or at least averages to zero, it is straightforward to determine the
sensitivity coefficients from the corresponding measurements of ADIFR,
QCF, PITCH, and GGVSPD, the latter near zero but possibly varying
a litte during the maneuver.

The weakness in this approach is that the angle of attack changes
slowly so the results might not represent the case where changes occur
rapidly, as might be the case when encountering sudden gusts of wind.
Lenschow, working with Marie Lothon, has presented evidence that the
airflow can have transient differences vs.~the steady-state conditions
in the presence of such gusts. If those transients affect the airflow
at the radome or the pitot tube used for QCF, they might caused the
angle of attack inferred from the standard sensitivity coefficients
to be in error.

Because the LAMS provides an independent measurement of the relative
wind and measures well ahead of the aircraft, it may be possible to
check for transient effects by comparing LAMS-based measurements to
radome-based measurements. The purpose of this memo is to document
a search for such effects and to place some preliminary limits on
how large the associated errors might be..

\section*{Data Used}

A test of the LAMS was conducted in Nov. 2014 during the project called
HCRTEST. Here the focus is on flight 3, Nov. 24 2014, because LAMS
worked well and the flight included standard maneuvers at altitudes
where the backscatter from aerosols was sufficient to provide good
signals for LAMS. The configuration for this flight was non-standard:
Beam 1 was upward as usual, but beam 2 was forward along the longitudinal
axis and beam 3 was outboard and downward. This is not an ideal configuration
for determining three-dimensional wind, but problems with flow distortion
when one beam was directed downward and inboard led to use of this
configuration. It provides the advantage of having a longitudinal
beam and so providing a good measurement of airspeed.

The flight included these maneuvers, flown at an altitude of about
6000~m and an airspeed of about 200 m/s except for the speed run:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{Maneuver} & \textbf{start } & \textbf{end}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
circle & 20:06:45 & 20:15:40\tabularnewline
\hline

\hline

\hline 
pitch & 20:46:00 & 20:48:10\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

There was a change in system configuration around 21:00 UTC to test
a different configuration, so that part of the flight will not be
used here. There was also a descent to about 2000\textasciitilde{}m
starting at 20:55, a climb from 2000 to 6000\textasciitilde{}m starting
about 21:10, then a straight segment to about 21:40 before the descent
back to RMMA. For most of these times, there was a solid LAMS signal,
so the flight provides a good test of the 3-beam LAMS.

\section*{LAMS data processing}

The calculations used to obtain wind measurements from the LAMS were
documented previously and won't be repeated here. Two processing routes
were used, that of Scott Spuler who obtained line-of-sight beam speeds
using a principle-component analysis and another that used the Python
processing program LAMS4beam-SG.py, which used Savitsky-Golay polynomials
to smooth the measured histograms of beam speeds from the measured
Doppler shift in the backscattered light and then detected peaks above
these smoothed histograms. Both will be shown and used here. Once
the line-of-sight speeds were measured, these were used to find the
three components of the relative wind as described in the memo LAMS4beam-SG.pdf
via combination of the relative wind and the ground-referenced motion
of the aircraft as measured by the C-MIGITSIII inertial reference
unit in the LAMS pod. The calculated variables are WD\_LAMS, WS\_LAMS,
WI\_LAMS, ATTACK\_L, and SSLIP\_L as well as U\_LAMS, V\_LAMS, and
W\_LAMS which represent the components of the three-dimensional wind.

In addition, it was necessary to adjust the measurements of heading
for a peculiarity in the data that introduced large jumps as the measurements
moved through a heading of 180$^{\circ}$ and, if not removed, produced
similar jumps in the measured horizontal wind. Interpolation through
these bad points removed these spurious measurements. The error that
led to this problem has since been corrected.

\section*{Example Results}

Figure~\ref{fig:transform} shows the wind measurements obtained
from LAMS and the standard measurements. . The measurements from LAMS
are independent of those from the standard system, so the general
agreement between these two sets of results is a good indication that
the three-beam version of LAMS is working well. The mean speed detected
in the forward-pointing beam was about 0.5~m/s larger than TASX and
the standard deviation in the difference over the period of this plot
is about 0.4~m/s. This is a little larger than the expected difference
from the previous studies with the single-beam LAMS, but the difference
remains relatively small so there is no evident problem. 

\section*{Maneuvers}

\subsection*{Speed run}

The speed run flown from 20:30\textendash 20:45 UTC provides a check
on the sensitivity coefficient determined for the standard system.
The inertial system mounted with the LAMS pod is installed so that
its pitch axis differs from the standard GV IRU by about 3.5$^{\circ},$with
the CMIGITS-III pointing downward relative to the Honeywell IRU. Measurements
from LAMS provide a measurement of angle of attack that is independent
of the standard measurement, so this measurement from LAMS can provide
an alternate reference angle for the determination of sensitivity
coefficients, but the resulting coefficients will differ substantially
in the constant-offset term because of the difference in installation
angles. Nevertheless, other terms in the sensitivity coefficients
determined in this way should match those determined in standard ways,
because the measurements from LAMS provide an absolute reference for
relative wind. 

<<attack-plot, include=TRUE, fig.cap="Angle of attack determined by the standard system (AKRD) plotted vs.\ the angle of attack determined from the LAMS. The orange dashed line is the regression line for AKRD as a function of the LAMS angle-of-attack.">>=

rb <- setRange (DW$Time, 203200,204200)
op <- par (mar=c(5,4,1,1)+0.1)
## exclude some obvious outliers:
DW$ATTACK[DW$ATTACK < -2] <- NA
plot(DW$ATTACK[rb], DW$AKRD[rb], type='p', pch=20, col='blue', ylab="Standard AKRD [deg.]", xlab="LAMS-based angle of attack [deg.]")
f <- lm(DW$AKRD[rb]~DW$ATTACK[rb])
cf <- coef(f)
print ("Fit results using the standard sensitivity coefficients for the GV")
SummarizeFit(f)
x <- c(-3.,2.)
y <- cf[1]+cf[2]*x
points (x,y, type='l', col='darkorange', lwd=3, lty=2)

@

Figure~\ref{fig:attack-plot} shows that there is good correlation
between these two measurements. The slope determined from a fit to
these measurements is about \Sexpr{round(cf[2], 2)}, with a standard
error of 0.005, and the correlation coefficient is above 0.99, so
this fit provides a low-uncertainty check on the sensitivity coefficients
for the radome. The residual standard deviation of AKRD measurements
about the best-fit line is about \Sexpr{round(summary(f)$sigma,2)}$^{\circ}$.
The large offset between the two systems is as expected for the difference
in installation angles. The \Sexpr{round((cf[2]-1)*100,0)}\% difference
in slope would lead to measurements of vertical wind that typically
differ by a similar percentage, so the resulting change is small but
not negligible. It is therefore useful to determine if there is other
evidence for this departure from unity slope. 

<<dw-calibration, include=TRUE>>=
Data$AKDW <- 4.468 + 21.481 * Data$ADIFR/Data$QCF
rc <- setRange (Data$Time, 203200, 204200)
fc <- lm (Data$AKDW[rc]~DW$ATTACK[rb])
print ("Fit results using the DEEPWAVE sensitivity coefficients for AKRD")
SummarizeFit(fc)
@

The calibration recommended for DEEPWAVE was slightly different and
based on measurements that emphasized upper-altitude flight conditions.
If those sensitivity coefficients, 4.468$^{\circ}$ and 21.481$^{\circ}$,
are used instead of the standard calibration then the regression slope
changes from \Sexpr{round(cf[2], 2)} to \Sexpr{round(coef(fc)[2], 2)}
and the standard deviation and standard error for the determination
of slope both decrease, as shown in the fit summary above.. Use of
the DEEPWAVE coefficients, according to the LAMS results, would lead
to a 2\% underestimate of vertical wind instead of a 4\% overestimate. 

From these results, it appears that the LAMS-provided measurements
support the standard calibration of the radome to within the typical
uncertainty of those determinations and there does not appear to be
a systematic error in those coefficients.

\subsection*{Yaw maneuver}

cfs <- coef(fd)
print (sprintf("Fit results using the standard sideslip calibration for the GV"))
SummarizeFit(fd)
x <- c(-2.,0.)
y <- cfs[1]+cfs[2]*x
points (x,y, type='l', col='darkorange', lwd=3, lty=2)
Data$SSDW <- 0.008 + 22.302 * Data$BDIFR / Data$QCF
rc <- setRange (Data$Time, 204300, 204600)
fe <- lm (Data$SSDW[rc]~DW$SSLIP[rd])
print (sprintf ("Fit results using the DEEPWAVE calibration for sideslip"))
SummarizeFit (fe)
@

The yaw maneuver flown from 20:43 to 20:46 UTC provides a similar
opportunity to check the sensitivity coefficient in use for sideslip.
Figure~\ref{fig:yaw} shows the standard measurement of sideslip
angle (SSRD) plotted against the sideslip angle determined from the
LAMS measurements. The regression line has slope \Sexpr{round(coef(fd)[2],2)},
indicating that the standard formula underestimates the sideslip angle
by about \Sexpr{round(-(coef(fd)[2]-1)*100,0)}\%. However, repeating
this with the calibration determined for DEEPWAVE, with coefficients
\{0.008, 22.302\}, gave a regression slope of \Sexpr{round(coef(fe)[2],3)}.
During DEEPWAVE, the yaw maneuver was flown in a different manner
to minimize roll changes, which may have affected previous calibrations,
so the DEEPWAVE sensitivity coefficients are a better representation
of the LAMS-measured sideslip and should be made the standard calibration
for the radome. They also include an offset, as discussed in the Technical
Note on wind uncertainty for the GV.

\subsection*{Pitch maneuver}

The pitch maneuver (20:46:00\textendash 20:48:10 UTC) should show
no residual pattern in the vertical wind that matches the imposed
vertical motion of the aircraft if both systems are operating properly.
Figure~\ref{fig:pitch} shows that both systems pass this test well.
While there is a residual standard deviation in vertical wind of about
0.15\textasciitilde{}m/s, this seems to be mostly natural variability
in the vertical wind because there is little correspondence between
the fluctuations and the imposed sine-wave pattern of the pitch maneuver.
The small offset between wind as measured by the two systems appears
to arise from differences in the pitch measurements from the two systems.
Otherwise, the pitch maneuver provides a good indication that both
systems are performing well.

<<pitch, include=TRUE, fig.cap="Pitch maneuver, HCRTEST flight 3, 20:46:00--20:48:10 UTC. WIN is the vertical wind determined solely from the measurements from LAMS, while WIC is the conventional radome-based vertical wind.

rf <- setRange (DW$Time, 204600,204745)
rf <- setRange (DW$Time, 204600,204810)
DW$WREF <- DW$GGVSPD / 10.
# plotWAC(DW[rf, c("Time", "WIC", "WIN", "WREF")])
# print (sprintf (" WIC std dev: %.2f; WI_LAMS std dev: %.2f", sd(DW$WIC[rf]), sd(DW$WIN[rf])))

@

The LAMS also provides an opportunity to check another assumption
used when determining the sensitivity coefficients. The coefficients
relating the radome measurements to angle of attack are determined
by fits to speed-run maneuvers, during which the pitch angle and angle
of attack vary slowly. There has been evidence that some transient
effects on the airflow might affect such measurements during more
rapidly changing conditions, such as might be encountered during sharp
changes in the vertical wind. To check for such effects, the pitch
maneuver provides faster changes and might reveal a dependence on,
for example, the rate of change of angle of attack or airspeed or
pitch.

For this study, it is useful to use measurements at higher rate, so
a different data file was constructed with measurements at 25~Hz
for the conventional variables needed for calculating wind and with
100-Hz measurements from LAMS. The 100-Hz measurements were then averaged
to 25~Hz. (This was necessary because of difficulty getting 25~Hz
measurements directly from nimbus, possibly because the required averaging
hasn't been implemented?)

The independent measurements of vertical wind, WIC from the radome-based
system and WIN from the LAMS, are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:two-winds}.
Also shown for reference is the vertical speed of the GV during the
maneuver, divided by 40 to avoid enlargement of the scale. Both measurements
of vertical wind are smoothed to about 5-Hz response to minimize fluctuations
between the systems that are likely of shorter scale than the separation
among the sampled beams in LAMS or the separation of those beams from
the radome. The resulting LAMS-based measurement WINS (green line)
still shows more high-frequency noise than the radome-based measurement
(WICS). The suspicious feature of this plot is the increase in WIC
(blue line) near and following the troughs in the rate-of-climb (red
line) and an associated decrease in WIC following the peaks in rate-of-climb,
features that are not apparent in the LAMS-based measurement WIN.
The pattern, correlated with vertical acceleration rather than vertical
speed, is suggestive of some airflow effect on WIC that is associated
with vertical acceleration,

Despite the consistency of the angle-of-attack comparison for the
two systems, there is more scatter between the two signals than would
be expected if both are measuring the same signal. For WIC, the standard
deviation is \Sexpr{round(sdWIC, 2)}~m/s for 25-Hz measurements
and the corresponding standard deviation for WIN is \Sexpr{round(sdWIN, 2)},
both similar to the standard deviation in vertical wind before and
after the pitch maneuvers, so the maneuver does not introduce a substantial
false signal. However, a comparison of the two measurements shows
considerable scatter, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:scplt}. A Deming
fit to these measurements gives a slope of \Sexpr{round(DF[2], 2)}
(WIN:WIC), so they are about of the same magnitude, but the RMS of
the Deming fit (characterizing the perpendicular distance from the
points to the fitted line) is \Sexpr{round(DF[3], 2)}~m/s while
the expected scatter for randomly distributed points with standard
deviation in each variable of \Sexpr{round(sdWIC, 2)}~m/s would
be \Sexpr{round(sdWIC*sqrt(2), 2)}~m/s, so the scatter about the
fitted line is about \Sexpr{round(DF[3]/(sdWIC*sqrt(2))*100, 0)}\%
of that expected without correlation. Although these differences represent
fairly small errors and the two measurements characterize different
spatial regions, this degree of scatter is still troubling because
it is comparable to our best claimed uncertainty for vertical wind.
It is therefore worthwhile to search for possible factors that might
distort one of the measurements, perhaps WIC as a result of flow distortion.

To investigate possible sources of this distortion, the difference
WIN-WIC was examined as a function of various factors with which it
might be correlated. Candidate factors include the rate of climb of
the aircraft (GGVSPD), the attack, pitch and sideslip angles, derivatives
of those angles, and the accelerations experienced by the aircraft.
Of these, vertical acceleration of the aircraft is a prime candidate,
as discussed in connection with Fig.~\ref{fig:two-winds}, and is
highly correlated with some of the other factors, so that is examined
first. The correlation between $\delta W$=(WIN-WIC) and vertical
acceleration, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:zaccel}, is \Sexpr{round(ccoef, 2)},
so this is strong evidence that the measurement of measured vertical
wind WIC may depend on the vertical acceleration. The LAMS-based measurement
WIN is sufficiently removed from the location of the aircraft that
transient flow effects are unlikely to affect it, so the effect is
more likely one on WIC. The regression leads to reduction of the residual
standard deviation of $\delta W$ from \Sexpr{round(sd(D$DWIC, na.rm=TRUE), 3)}
to \Sexpr{round(summary(faz)$sigma, 3)}~m/s, which suggests that
the false component of vertical wind introduced by vertical acceleration
might be about \Sexpr{round(fsd, 2)}~m/s.

@

Another flight characteristic with some correlation to WIN-WIC is
sideslip, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sideslip}. In this case, the
correlation is much smaller, about \Sexpr{round(summary(fss)$sigma, 2)},
but the dependence on sideslip appears to be real so including this
dependence can reduce the residual standard deviation in $\delta W$
slightly. The coefficients for the best fit including dependence on
both vertical acceleration and sideslip are \{$c_{0},\,c_{1},\,c_{2}$\}
= \{\Sexpr{round(cftot[1], 4)}\,m\,s$^{-1}$, \Sexpr{round(cftot[2], 4)}\,s,
\Sexpr{round(cftot[3], 4)}\,m\,s$^{-1}/^{\circ}$\} as used in
the following equation (where $\dot{w}_{p}$ is the vertical acceleration
of the aircraft and $\beta$ the sideslip angle ) and characterized
by the table that follows:
\begin{equation}
\delta W=c_{0}+c_{1}\dot{w}_{p}+c_{2}\beta\label{eq:deltaW}

@

Angle of attack is highly correlated with vertical acceleration during
the pitch maneuvers, so a plot like Fig.~\ref{fig:zaccel} but for
AKRD shows a similar strong correlation. Because the direct dependence
on AKRD is calibrated for the radome-based system, it is more likely
that the dependence is on vertical acceleration, which is not significant
during the speed runs used for calibration. A similar plot of $\delta W$
(WIN-WIC) vs rate-of-climb shows only a weak correlation (about 0.15)
and negligible reduction in the residual standard deviation, so rate-of-climb
does not appear to introduce any substantial error. Longitudinal acceleration
of the aircraft also does not show any substantial effect. Other factors
showing negligible correlation to $\delta W$ are the horizontal acceleration
and the rate-of-change in angle of attack.

The other candidate factor that does show substantial correlation
to $\delta W$ is the rate of change of pitch, which is almost as
strongly correlated to WIN-WIC as vertical acceleration. However,
the rate of change of pitch ($\dot{\theta}$) is also highly correlated
with vertical acceleration during the pitch maneuver (correlation
coefficient 0.96) so it is not clear which is the cause of the difference
between WIN and WIC. The rate of change of pitch enters the calculation
of vertical wind directly because it determines the relative motion
of the radome gust probe vs the IRU and GPS antenna, and a similar
offset applies to the difference between the motion of the LAMS sensor,
the LAMS IRU, and the GPS antenna. However, in the calculations of
vertical wind used for this study, these rotation-rate effects were
incorporated in the processing, using distances of 4.42~m (radome
to Honeywell IRU), -4.30~m (Honeywell IRU to GPS antenna), and +6.0~m
(LAMS to GPS antenna). A false correlation between $\delta W$ and
$\dot{\theta}$ of the magnitude observed would require an additional
displacement of about 15~m (radome forward of the IRU by an additional
15~m or GPS antenna behind the IRU by an additional 15~m), or alternately
the LAMS to be \emph{forward }of the GPS antenna by an additional
15~m. The focal points for the LAMS beams are ahead of the housing
by more than this distance, but they each detect only line-of-sight
airspeed so no lever arm like that for the radome-IRU displacement
is needed, and in any case the observed sensitivity to rotation would
require a sensing location \emph{behind} the LAMS housing. A correction
has already been made for the 6~m longitudinal displacement between
the GPS antenna and the LAMS IRU, so the rotation-rate correction
to measured velocity does not appear able to account for the observed
dependence.

If the fit coefficients in the list of fit parameters as a function
of vertical acceleration and sideslip are used to correct the radome-based
vertical wind, the result is the variable WIXS shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:corrected-w}
as the blue line. The match to the LAMS-measured vertical wind (green
line) is good, and the problems evident in Fig.~4 have been corrected.
The RMS difference between the two signals (after averaging to about
5-Hz signals) is \Sexpr{round(sd(D$WIXS-D$WINS, na.rm=TRUE), 2)}~m/s,
which is reasonable considering the claimed uncertainty in both and
the difference in locations being measured by the two sensors. The
vertical acceleration and the rotation rate experienced during the
pitch maneuver are larger than those experienced during typical encounters
with turbulence or waves, and the correction for vertical acceleration
and sideslip in the pitch maneuver has a typical magnitude of \Sexpr{round(sd(D$WIN-D$WIX), 2)}~m/s,
so the error arising from transient flow distortion (if that is indeed
the cause) is smaller than the estimated uncertainty in the measurement
of vertical wind (standard uncertainty of 0.12~m/s) in most representative
measuring conditions. However, the RMS of the Deming fit to the LAMS-derived
and the radome-derived vertical wind (WIN, WIC) is reduced from \Sexpr{round(DF[3], 2)}
to \Sexpr{round(DemingFit(D$WIN, D$WIX)[3], 2)} by this correction,
so the correction, although small, can be worth including in analyses
requiring the lowest-uncertainty results.

\section*{Conclusions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The independent measurements from LAMS provide good support for the
usual method used to determine sensitivity coefficients from maneuvers.
The LAMS measurements confirm the values of the sensitivity coefficients
in use to within a few percent. The revised SSRD sensitivity coefficients
documented in the Wind Uncertainty Tech Note match the LAMS result
very well and should be adopted as the standard GV coefficients.
\item The pitch maneuver revealed that the difference between the LAMS-derived
vertical wind and that from the radome-based system varied with the
vertical acceleration, and that difference was larger than expected
from uncertainty analyses of the two systems. A weak dependence on
sideslip was also present. The estimated magnitude of the effects,
however, are small, leading to typical errors in WIC of about 0.1~m/s
when the vertical acceleration was in the range $\pm1\thinspace$m\,s$^{-2}$,
as is typical of all but the most extreme flight conditions.
\item A correction formula (Eq.~\ref{eq:deltaW}) can be used to remove
the error in vertical wind. After application of that regression correction
based on the pitch maneuver, the measurements of vertical wind from
the radome-based system agree with those from the LAMS with a standard
deviation between the two measurements of only 0.07~m/s during that
pronounced maneuver. This confirms the ability of the measuring system
to remove the effects of even rapid pilot-induced changes in pitch,
leading to rates-of-climb exceeding $\pm10$~m/s, so that less than
1\% of the induced motion appears in the measurements.
