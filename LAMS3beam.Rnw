\section{Introduction}

A test of the LAMS was conducted in Nov. 2014 during the project called
HCRTEST. Here the focus is on flight 3, Nov. 24 2014, because LAMS
worked well and the flight included standard maneuvers at altitudes
where the backscatter from aerosols was sufficient to provide good
signals for LAMS. The configuration for this flight was non-standard:
Beam 1 was upward as usual, but beam 2 was forward along the longitudinal
axis and beam 3 was outboard and downward. This is not an ideal configuration
for determining three-dimensional wind, but problems with flow distortion
when one beam was directed downward and inboard led to use of this
configuration. It provides the advantage of having a longitudinal
beam and so providing a good measurement of airspeed.

The flight included these maneuvers, flown at an altitude of about
6000~m and an airspeed of about 200 m/s except for the speed run:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{Maneuver} & \textbf{Start {[}UTC{]}} & \textbf{End {[}UTC{]}}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
circle & 20:06:45 & 20:15:40\tabularnewline
\hline 
speed run & 20:32:00 & 20:42:00\tabularnewline
\hline

\hline 
pitch & 20:46:00 & 20:48:10\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}

There was a change in system configuration around 21:00 UTC to test
a different configuration, so that part of the flight will not be
used here. There was also a descent to about 2000~m starting at 20:55,
a climb from 2000 to 6000~m starting about 21:10, then a straight
segment to about 21:40 before the descent back to RMMA. For most of
these times, there was a solid LAMS signal, so the flight provides
a good test of the 3-beam LAMS.


\section{LAMS data processing}

The calculations used to obtain wind measurements from the LAMS were
documented previously and won't be repeated here. Two processing routes
were used, that of Scott Spuler who obtained line-of-sight beam speeds
using a principle-component analysis and another that used the Python
processing program LAMS4beam-SG.py, which used Savitsky-Golay polynomials
to smooth the measured histograms of beam speeds from the measured
Doppler shift in the backscattered light and then detected peaks above
these smoothed histograms. Both will be shown and used here. Once
the line-of-sight speeds were measured, these were used to find the
three components of the relative wind as described in the memo LAMS4beam-SG.pdf
via combination of the relative wind and the ground-referenced motion
of the aircraft as measured by the C-MIGITSIII inertial reference
unit in the LAMS pod. The calculated variables are WD\_LAMS, WS\_LAMS,
WI\_LAMS, ATTACK\_L, and SSLIP\_L as well as U\_LAMS, V\_LAMS, and
W\_LAMS which represent the components of the three-dimensional wind.

\section{Example results}

Figure~\ref{fig:transform} shows the wind measurements obtained
from LAMS in comparison to the standard measurements. In addition
to the processing described above, it was necessary to adjust the
measurements of heading for a peculiarity in the data that introduced
large jumps as the measurements moved through a heading of 180$^{\circ}$
and, if not removed, produced similar jumps in the measured horizontal
wind. Interpolation through these bad points removed these spurious
measurements. The measurements from LAMS are independent of those
from the standard system, so the general agreement between these two
sets of results is a good indication that the three-beam version of
LAMS is working well. The mean speed detected in the forward-pointing
beam was about 0.5~m/s larger than TASX and the standard deviation
in the difference over the period of this plot is about 0.4~m/s.
This is somewhat larger than the expected difference but fairly small,
so there is no evident problem. 


\section{Maneuvers}


\subsection{Speed run}

The speed run flown from 20:30--20:45 UTC provides a check on the
sensitivity coefficient determined for the standard system because,
although there may be an offset the differs between the two systems,
the two measurements should correlate well with unity slope if the
sensitivity coefficient in standard processing is correct, because
the LAMS measurements provide an absolute reference for relative wind.
Figure~\ref{fig:attack-plot} shows that there is good correlation
between these two measurements. The slope determined from a fit to
these measurements is about 1.04, with a standard error of 0.005,
and the correlation coefficient is above 0.99, so this fit provides
a low-uncertainty check on the sensitivity coefficients for the radome.
The residual standard deviation of AKRD measurements about the best-fit
line is about 0.1$^{\circ}$. The large offset, 3.7$^{\circ}$, between
the two systems reflects that they are installed with different orientation,
as confirmed by the similar difference in pitch measurements from
the two IRUs. At a flight speed of 200~m/s, an angle-of-attack change
of 0.1$^{\circ}$ would produce a change in measured updraft of about
3.5~m/s, so a change in that value of 4\% would change the measured
updraft by 4\% also or about 0.14~m/s. This uncertainty is thus not
negligible, so it is useful to determine if there is other evidence
for this shift.

@

The calibration recommended for DEEPWAVE was slightly different and
based on measurements that emphasized upper-altitude flight conditions.
If those sensitivity coefficients, 4.468$^{\circ}$ and 21.481$^{\circ}$,
are used instead of the standard calibration then the regression slope
changes from 1.04 to 0.98 and the standard deviation and standard
error for the determination of slope both decrease. Use of these coefficients,
according to the LAMS results, would lead to a 2\% underestimate of
vertical wind instead of a 4\% overestimate.

fc <- lm (Data$AKDW[rc]~DW$ATTACK[rb])
print ("Fit results using the DEEPWAVE sensitivity coefficients for AKRD")
SummarizeFit(fc)

\subsection{Yaw maneuver}

The yaw maneuver flown from 20:43 to 20:46 UTC provides a similar
opportunity to check the sensitivity coefficient in use for sideslip.
Figure~\ref{fig:yaw} shows the standard measurement of sideslip
angle (SSRD) plotted against the sideslip angle determined from the
LAMS measurements. The regression line has slope 0.94, indicating
that the standard formula underestimates the sideslip angle by about
6\%. However, repeating this with the calibration determined for DEEPWAVE,
with coefficients \{0.008, 22.302\}, gave a regression slope of 0.994,
so this is a better representation of the LAMS-measured sideslip and
should be made the standard calibration.

@


\subsection{Pitch maneuver}

The pitch maneuver (20:46:00--20:48:10 UTC) should show no residual
pattern in the vertical wind that matches the imposed vertical motion
of the aircraft if both systems are operating properly. Figure~\ref{fig:pitch}
shows that both systems pass this test well. While there is a residual
standard deviation in vertical wind of about 0.15~m/s, this seems
to be mostly natural variability in the vertical wind because there
is little correspondence between the fluctuations and the imposed
sine-wave pattern of the pitch maneuver. The small offset between
wind as measured by the two systems appears to arise from differences
in the pitch measurements from the two systems. Otherwise, the pitch
maneuver provides a good indication that both systems are performing
well.
